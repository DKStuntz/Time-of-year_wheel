# Time-of-year_wheel
Writ. May 28, 2016:
A design-practice app that shows the year as a circle, and has an arrow that points to the current time of year.

While this app may not have much conventional use (as most people don't need an app to figure out what time of year it is), its creation provided a great source of design practice, including use of the "Date" function, and the "transform: rotate ..." CSS statement.  
And, who knows? -- perhaps it could help a child grasp the concept of circular time patterns, etc.

I plan to upgrade it in the future.
